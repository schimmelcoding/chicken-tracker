## Project Ideas
this area is mainly for brainstorming ideas about how the project will work
- the inital idea is for a one user program that won't require log in inorder to use.
- users can track how many chickens they have
- users can view chickens by breed, age, or gender
- egg tracking can be handled by individual chicken, by breed, or by flock.
